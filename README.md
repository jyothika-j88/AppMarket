2. RapidAPI: App Store Scraper API
o URL: https://rapidapi.com/rapidapihub123/api/appstore-scrapper-api
o Contains: Real-time app performance data, rankings, competitor analysis
Technical Requirements:
‚óè Implement robust data ingestion pipeline
‚óè Handle API rate limits and error scenarios
‚óè Data validation and cleaning processes
‚óè Unified data schema for downstream processing

Expected Output:
‚óè Clean, normalized dataset combining both sources
‚óè Automated data refresh mechanism

Phase 2: AI-Powered Insight Generation
Deliverable: Intelligent Analysis Engine
