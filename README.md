App Market Intelligence System

Overview
The **App Market Intelligence System** is a Python-based platform designed to generate executive-level insights and reports on mobile apps. It combines multi-source data collection, AI-powered analysis, automated report generation, and an intelligent query interface to support strategic decisions for app developers, marketers, and product managers.

The system is divided into four main phases:

1. **Data Collection & Integration**
2. **AI-Powered Insight Generation**
3. **Automated Report Generation**
4. **Query Interface & Local Storage**

## Project Phases

### **Phase 1: Data Collection & Integration**
**Deliverable:** Multi-source Data Pipeline  

**Primary Data Sources:**
1. **Kaggle Dataset: Google Play Store Apps**  
   - URL: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps)  
   - Contains app metadata, ratings, reviews, categories, pricing  

2. **RapidAPI: App Store Scraper API**  
   - URL: [RapidAPI App Store Scraper](https://rapidapi.com/rapidapihub123/api/appstore-scrapper-api)  
   - Provides real-time app performance data, rankings, and competitor analysis  

**Technical Requirements:**
- Robust data ingestion pipeline  
- Handle API rate limits and error scenarios  
- Data validation and cleaning  
- Unified data schema for downstream processing  

**Expected Output:**
- Clean, normalized dataset combining both sources  
- Automated data refresh mechanism
